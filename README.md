# O-Level_Math_Score_RegressionSelfPractice
A machine learning project to predict O-Level Math Score using data preprocessing and model training pipelines. Built with Python, this project leverages libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and YAML for configuration.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing of O-Level Math Score data
- Feature engineering (e.g., converting strings like CCA to nominal features)
- Training and evaluation of baseline models (Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso)
- Hyperparameter tuning for Ridge and Lasso models using GridSearchCV
- Model evaluation with metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE, R² score)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://jonyling@github.com/AIAP-Foundation/jonyling-RegressionSelfPractice.git
   cd O-Level_Math_Pred

2. **Install dependencies**:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Set up configuration**:

    Ensure the config.yaml file is in the root directory with the correct path to your dataset (e.g., regression_bonus_practice_data.csv).
    Update the target_column, val_size, and other parameters as needed.

4. **Run the project**:

    ```bash
    python main.py

## Usage

- Data Preparation: The data_preparation.py script cleans and preprocesses the O-Level Math Score data, handling missing values, duplicates, and feature transformations.
- Model Training: The model_training.py script trains baseline models and performs hyperparameter tuning, evaluating models with various metrics.
- Main Execution: Run main.py to execute the full pipeline, including data splitting, model training, and evaluation.

## Configuration

The project uses a config.yaml file for configuration. Key parameters include:
    file_path: Path to the dataset (e.g., O-Level Math Score.csv).
    target_column: The column to predict (e.g., final_test).
    val_size: Validation set size (e.g., 0.3).
    param_grid: Hyperparameter grid for Ridge and Lasso (e.g., alpha: [0.1, 1, 10, 100, 1000]).
    scoring: Evaluation metric (e.g., r2).
    numerical_features, nominal_features, ordinal_features: Lists of feature types for preprocessing.
Edit config.yaml to customize the pipeline for your dataset.
